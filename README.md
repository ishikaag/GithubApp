# GithubApp
This is a web application which fetches the information from an API and display the result.
This application features:
1. Show All users - with username and their avatar
2. Search users by username
3. Display followers for each user (when click on followers tab)
4. Display repository for each user (when clicked on username tab)

5. Pagination (incomplete)

## Known bug
The application currently require user to refresh the page every time he switches between search and showAll. I am currently working on the fix. Please find the contact information below for any questions.
